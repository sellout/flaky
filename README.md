Sellout’s very opinionated personal project configuration.

## development environment

We recommend the following steps to make working in this repository as easy as possible.

### `direnv allow`

This command ensures that any work you do within this repository happens within a consistent reproducible environment. That environment provides various debugging tools, etc. When you leave this directory, you will leave that environment behind, so it doesn’t impact anything else on your system.

### `git config --local include.path ../.config/git/config`

This will apply our repository-specific Git configuration to `git` commands run against this repository. It’s lightweight (you should definitely look at it before applying this command) – it does things like telling `git blame` to ignore formatting-only commits.
