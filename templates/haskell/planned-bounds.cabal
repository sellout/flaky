cabal-version: 3.4

name: planned-bounds
version: 0.1.0.0
synopsis: Dependency bounds as determined by `cabal-plan-bounds`.
description: This is a non-built package intended to catch changes in our
             dependency bounds. The actual packages use slightly different
             bounds in some cases (always accompanied by a comment), and a
             clearer syntax (see cabal-plan-bounds#18). This allows us to still
             have a check that fails and forces us to review changes without
             having to match `cabal-plan-bounds`â€™ results exactly.
