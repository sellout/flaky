## building & development

Especially if you are unfamiliar with the {{type.name}} ecosystem, there is a Nix build (both with and without a flake). If you are unfamiliar with Nix, [Nix adjacent](...) can help you get things working in the shortest time and least effort possible.

### if you have `nix` installed

`nix build` will build the project and run tests.

`nix flake check` will validate the state of the repo â€“ formatting, linting, etc.

`nix develop` will put you into an environment where the traditional build tooling works. If you also have `direnv` installed, then you should automatically be in that environment when you're in a directory in this project.

### traditional build

This project can be built with GNU Autotools
```bash
automake
./configure
make
```

## versioning

In the absolute, almost every change is a breaking change. This section describes how we mitigate that to provide minor updates and revisions.
